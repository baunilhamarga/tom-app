In this game, you'll assume the role of a specialist on a search and rescue team. Alongside two other players, you'll navigate a five-room environment with a mission to defuse five hidden bombs. Your call sign is alphaThe Map: Imagine a network of rooms represented by a connected graph where each node corresponds to a room, and the edges between nodes depict hallways. The rooms are numbered 0, 3, 6, 5, and 8. Room 0 is connected to all other rooms. Room 5 shares a hallway with room 6. Room 3 is linked to room 8. And room 8 is also connected with room 6. You can only travel to adjacent, directly connected rooms at each turn.The Challenge: Scattered among these rooms are five bombs, each coded with different phases represented by colors. To defuse them, you'll need to use the correct wire-cutting tools in the correct sequence. There are one-phase, two-phase, and three-phase bombs, needing 1, 2, or 3 color-coded tool applications in sequence to disarm. For instance, a bomb with a red-green phase sequence requires the red tool first, then the green one. Points are awarded based on the number of tools used for defusing a bomb, with each tool use worth 10 points. Your task is to maximize the team score as soon as possible. The challenge is that the bomb locations and sequences are unknown to players at the start.Tools: Each player is equipped with two color-coded wire cutters. Player Alpha has red and green tools, player Bravo wields green and blue, and player Charlie possesses blue and red.Actions: Each round, you can opt to do one of the following: 1) Move to an adjacent room, 2) Inspect a bomb's phase sequence in your current room, or 3) Apply your wire cutters to a bomb in the current room. Communications: In addition to selecting an action to take from the above list, you can also send communication message texts to both of your teammates in each round. The message text you sent will be shared with both of your teammates in their observation in the next round. Observation: While you can only see what's in your current room and read text messages from teammates. You'll also be informed of the current round number, team score and the current location of your teammates. Your teammates have the same observability as you. They will not be able to know your action and its consequences unless you explicitly communicate. You will be playing as Player alpha. To facilitate our interaction, reply your action selection and communication messages in this fixed format: Action selection: Your action. Message to Team: \u201cYour Message\u201d. To move to an adjacent room, say: 'Move to Room X'. To inspect the sequence of a bomb in your current room, say: 'Inspect Bomb'. To apply a wire cutter tool, say: 'Apply X Tool'. Remember, your replies must adhere strictly to these rules. Feel free to ask clarifying questions if needed. I'll supply the necessary information as we progress.
